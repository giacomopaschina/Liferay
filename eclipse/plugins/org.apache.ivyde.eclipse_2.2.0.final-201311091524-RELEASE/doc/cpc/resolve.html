            <br class="xooki-br"/>You can explicitly ask for Ivy dependency resolution from your classpath container.<br class="xooki-br"/><br class="xooki-br"/>This command will invoke the "resolve" Ivy task and update your classpath container.<br class="xooki-br"/><br class="xooki-br"/>There is also a "refresh" action: this action is similar to the resolve one, but does not perform a full resolve if a report already exists in the cache. This is particularly useful if you work with Apache Ant and a command line so that you avoid two full resolves.  It is also the default action performed on classpath containers when the Eclipse workspace is opened (<b>Windows > Preferences > Ivy</b>), in effect restoring the classpath container to its state prior to the last closing of the workspace if no other action is performed against the ivy.xml in the meantime.<br class="xooki-br"/><br class="xooki-br"/>And there is a "reload settings" action: by default IvyDE does reload ivy settings files each time a resolve it required. But in case the ivy settings file is remote, this take make the user experience quite slow. To work around that, you can check in the <a href="../preferences.html">preference page</a> the option to only load on demand, and use the "reload settings" action in the context menu.<br class="xooki-br"/><br class="xooki-br"/><center><img src="../images/cp_resolve.jpg"></center><br/>

You can also trigger a resolve (not a refresh!) of every IvyDE classpath container in the workspace via the button in the tool bar of Eclipse.<br class="xooki-br"/><br class="xooki-br"/><center><img src="../images/resolveall.jpg"></center><br/>

And to launch a resolve on a specified selection of projects:
<ul>
<li>Select the projects you want to resolve in the package view,</li>
<li>Open the context menu with a right click</li>
<li>Choose <b>Ivy > Resolve</b></li>
</ul>
